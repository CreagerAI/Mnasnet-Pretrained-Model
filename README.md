# Mnasnet-Imagenet1k-Pretrained

### Introduction

This is a Mxnet implementation of Google's MnasNet. For details, please read the following papers:

- [MnasNet: Platform-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11626.pdf)

### Pretrained Models on ImageNet

We provide pretrained MobileNet models on ImageNet-1K, The ImageNet-1k is not the standard ILSRVRC 2012 ,which was extracted from imagenet 11k and split it to 95:5 (train:val).

| Network    | Top-1   |   Top-5   |
